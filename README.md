# Cyclistic Customer Analysis

### Project Overview

In this case study, we will work for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders and customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic annual members. The marketing director believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. He has set a clear goal to Design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. However, the marketing analyst team needs to understand better how annual members and casual riders differ.

### Data Sources
